                Aries contains no very bright stars; the brightest star, Hamal (Arabic for “sheep”), has a magnitude of 2.0. The first point of Aries, or vernal equinox, is an intersection of the celestial equator with the apparent annual pathway of the Sun and the point in the sky from which celestial longitude and right ascension are measured. The vernal equinox no longer lies in Aries but has been moved into Pisces by the precession of the equinoxes.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="para1">
            According to the tropical system of astrology, the Sun enters the sign of Aries when it reaches the March equinox, which occurs on average on March 21 (by design). Because the Earth takes approximately 365.24 days to go around the Sun, the precise time of the equinox is not the same each year, and generally will occur about six hours later from one year to the next until reset by a leap year. February 29 of a leap year causes that year's vernal equinox to fall about eighteen hours earlier—according to the calendar—compared with the previous year. From 1800 to 2050 inclusive the vernal equinox date has (or will) range(d) from March 19 at 22:34 UT1 in 2048 to March 21 at 19:15 UT1 in 1903.[1].

            HISTORY
        </p>
        <p class="para1">
            In astrology, Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about March 21 to about April 19. Its representation as a ram is identified with the Egyptian god Amon and, in Greek mythology, with the ram with the golden fleece, on the back of which Phrixus, the son of King Athamas, safely fled Thessaly to Colchis, where he sacrificed the ram to Zeus, who placed it in the heavens as the constellation. The ram’s golden fleece was recovered by Jason, leader of the Argonauts.

            First, a bit of history—Tarot got its start as a card game in the 15th century. So while it may seem like
            reading cards is an ancient practice, the use of Tarot for divination really came into its own in the 18th
            century. Because the Tarot deals in archetypes (or universal symbols), the meanings of each card and the
            stories those meanings tell span culture, continent, and time.</p>

            Aries traits: Personality and characteristics you need to know:
        </p>
        <p class="para1">
            The star sign Aries, born between March 21st and April 20th, are loud, proud, strong and brave. They are the ~baby~ of the zodiac, only in that they are the first sign and therefore the most ~raw~ with their needs, demands and emotions. They can, tbf, be pretty needy. Aries command your total attention, loyalty and capacity to entertain them… They get bored REAL fast.

                Aries have a very warm and passionate nature. Their Mars ruler makes them competitive and full-on too. They have a big presence, they can light up a room. And, mostly, they’re lovely to be around because they genuinely care about other people. Just don’t get into a competition with them, because we all know how that will end up.
                
                To get an idea of the classic Aries personality traits and types, we need only to look to some of the most famous rams (the sign’s animal): Lady Gaga, Sarah Jessica Parker, Mariah Carey and Chance the Rapper to name a few.

            <p class="para1 subhead1 "><b></b>Typical Aries personality traits</p>
            <p class="para1 subhead1 none">Courageous (read: reckless)</p>
            <p class="para1" >Most Aries bods spent a fair amount of their lives in A&E departments as a result of some dare or escapade to demonstrate their bravery. They act first and think later, and have little to no personal anxiety about their safety or ability to do dangerous things.</p>

            <p class="para1 subhead1 none">Competitive (read: insecure)</p>
            <p class="para1" 1>Steer away from the mini golf, Monopoly, playing cards or even that harmless little pub quiz machine because whatever is presented as a challenge to an Aries immediately becomes a battle. Underneath this hard-wired competitive streak lies a really vulnerable achilles heel: insecurity. Deep DEEP down, all Aries wonder if they’re really, truly good enough</p>

            <p class="para1 subhead1 none">Honest (read: tactless)</p>
            <p class="para1" 1>The most guileless, innocent and trusting of the signs - maybe because they are the zodiac’s baby i.e. the first sign. Ask them anything and they’ll tell you what they think, like, ANYTHING. But there’s no malice, snideness or bad intentions in their outspokenness. They just wear their heart on their sleeve.</p>

            <p class="para1 subhead1 none">Driven (read: pressurised)</p>
            <p class="para1" 1>All Aries want to succeed, get to the top, to ‘win’ at life and, as such, they’re usually all grafters and ambitious go-getters. But, remember that secret insecurity? It’s there, always, nagging at them, and this can make for a lot of internalised stress and pressure - all self-inflicted. Aries needs to learn to chill out and be nicer to themselves sometimes.</p>

            <p class="para1 subhead1 none">Generous (read: overbearing)</p>
            <p class="para1" 1>Aries are all giving, warm and generous people. They love making others smile and be happy... But they kinda see that as a competition too and, before you know it, they’re showing up to share their well-meaning (but uninvited) gifts and advice (always, the advice…)</p>

            <p class="para1 subhead1 none">Energetic (read: exhausting)</p>
            <p class="para1" 1>Aries would happily bounce and flounce around from dawn 'til dusk, when it comes to their never-ending energy levels.</p>

            The major arcana is made up of cards that directly represent archetypes, and suggest major themes and
            lessons that the querent (the subject of the reading) should pay attention to.


        </p>
        <p class="para1">
            There are many cards in your deck that symbolize impending change. If cards from the major arcana—think
            Death, or The Tower—show up, that means that the changes are going to be big, important, and an opportunity
            for a life-altering lesson.
        </p>
        <p class="para1">
            Of course, not all of the cards that comprise the major arcana are created equal. Depending on your deck—and
            they are available in increasing, and increasingly creative, numbers—some card names may be altered. Be sure
            to read up on your deck to catch all of its idiosyncrasies.

            The minor arcana is separated into four suits—wands, swords, cups, and pentacles, traditionally—and each
            suit relates to a facet of human experience. Wands represent action and motivation; swords represent thought
            processes and decision-making; cups represent feelings and emotions; and pentacles represent the material
            world, as in work and finances.

            HOROSCOPE
        </p>
        <p class="para1">
            horoscope, in astrology, a chart of the heavens, showing the relative positions of the Sun, the Moon, the planets, and the ascendant and midheaven signs of the zodiac at a specific moment in time. A horoscope is used to provide information about the present and to predict events to come.

            An individual horoscope usually plots the moment of birth and is used by astrologers to analyze character, as well as—in conjunction with other astrological data—to predict the future. This is in accordance with the belief that each celestial body has its own mythological character, modified according to its geometric relationship with the other celestial bodies at a given moment. Everything in the universe being interrelated, these bodies exert an influence, particularly on the newborn. In casting a horoscope, the heavens are commonly represented by a circle divided into 12 intersections, called houses. Each of these houses is assigned several departments of human life, such as wealth or marriage. The planet that falls within a particular house is said to influence matters pertaining to that house.

It spans 330° to 360° of celestial longitude. Under the tropical zodiac, the sun transits this area between February 19 and March 20.[a] In sidereal astrology, the Sun currently transits the constellation of Pisces from approximately March 12 to April 18.[4][5] In classical interpretations, the symbol of the fish is derived from the ichthyocentaurs, who aided Aphrodite when she was born from the sea.[6]</p>
